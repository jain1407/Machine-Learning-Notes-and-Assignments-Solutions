# Machine-Learning-Notes-and-Assignments-Solutions
This is a repository where I will post all of my detailed notes on Machine Learning Lectures for the Waterloo CS 485/685 course which offers a reasonable coverage of the field. In addition, I will also upload my solutions for the assignments that are offered in the course. Note: this repository is for educational purposes and these notes will also be a part of a medium article series for people looking to get a detailed overview of the field. I will be constantly updating that series and adding all of my notes sequentially and then further refine them for greater readibility.
